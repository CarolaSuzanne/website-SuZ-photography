                <p>The world seems organized, but when you look again, there are so many things we can not explain. What seems normal can become absurd, when we can't fit it in our understanding of what we were taught. I like to look again and make work
                    that is alienating but still from our world. Objects can have multiple purposes and often you can use or see them in different ways. Or even things we judge as ‘normal’ can be turned into other forms, another image. What is reality?</p>
